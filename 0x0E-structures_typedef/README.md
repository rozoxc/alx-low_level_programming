# Structures in C

Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow you to group different variables under a single name. Each variable inside a structure is called a "member" or "field." Structures are useful for organizing and managing related data in your programs.

## Defining a Structure

To define a structure in C, you use the `struct` keyword followed by the structure's name. Here's an example:

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};
