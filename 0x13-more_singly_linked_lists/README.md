## Introduction

This project provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C/C++. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This project is a great starting point for learning how linked lists work and can be used as a foundation for more complex data structure projects.

## Features

- Creation of a singly linked list.
- Insertion of elements at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- Deletion of elements from the list.
- Searching for elements in the list.
- Printing the list.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual C++).
- An IDE or code editor of your choice.
- Basic knowledge of C/C++ programming.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linked-list-project.git
